- 👋 Hi, I’m @ChrisAlden
- 👀 I’m interested in doing meaningful work that leaves the world in a better place than when I entered it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Rust
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making twitter bots
- 📫 How to reach me chris@greenzombie.net

- This is mostly an experiment. I want to see if I can use github for a couple of my projects. 
- To see if it is easier than just having everything in folders on my computer.
